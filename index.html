    // jQuery doesn't cache elements for you.

    // look beneath these declarations at the other functions, they are using these pre declared variables and applying JQuery methods to them!
    let domContainer = $(document)
    let windowContainer = $(window)
    let h1Container = $('h1')
    let buttonContainer = $('button')



    // JQuery supports functional programing, so you can create functions and call them later, i prefer this style of writing code over others since i find it cleaner to read later on
    function onLoadChangeH1Content() {
        h1Container.html('DONT CLICK THE BUTTON!!!!this is a JQuery tutorial, and its meant to be expirienced with the code source by side, if you have it click the button')
        console.log('The content of the h1s was modified on load')
    }
    // you can also apply styles with JQuery, here were using bootstrap so we just add a class and it gets styled for us
    function styleTheButton() {
        buttonContainer.addClass("btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block")
    }
    // but we could use the .css() method that comes with JQuery to style the selected element
    function createABorder() {
        h1Container.css("border", "1px solid black")
        console.log('the border arounde the h1s was generated when the DOM state was ready')
    }

    //this is an on load run a function, and what it does is that it waits for the window (you can interpret it as the webpage itself) has finished loading evrething before executing
    // for example, lets say we sent a 1 Gigabite image with the html document that is the webpage, this following function would not run until it finished downloading evreything
    // including the 1 Gigabite image ==>
    domContainer.ready(createABorder)
    windowContainer.on("load", onLoadChangeH1Content)
    windowContainer.on("load", styleTheButton)

    // you can click the button now !











    // ideal way to write clean functions and latter calling them ==>
